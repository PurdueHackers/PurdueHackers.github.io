      <h4>What do you mean by "hacker"?</h4>
      <p>A hacker is simply someone who "hacks". "What's that mean?", you ask? We think
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> sums it up best when he said,
      "It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in
      common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit
      of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value". "</p>
      
      <h4>What kind of culture do you want to bring to Purdue?</h4>     
      <p>We think in pursuit of obtaining higher U.S. World and Report rankings and fight against grade inflation, we've all missed the
      bigger picture about why college is worth doing - the people you meet and ideas they help you generate. We see hacker culture at
      Purdue changing all of that. We want a future where Purdue is known as the school in the Big 10 where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>students create things out of a passion for doing so - not because they were assigned to a project</li>
        <li>students are known to thrive in dynamic, unstructured, and fast paced environments like startups and small teams</li>
        <li>students sell what they make instead of sell out</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>That's what hacker culture at Purdue looks like.</p>
      
      <h4>How do you plan to do that?</h4>
      <p>We host a ton of events each year such as hack nights where anyone can come to create, meet and network with
      fellow hackers, and most importantly learn from one another. We also host tech talks where members and industry professionals
      talk about how they're using the latest and greatest technology to build amazing things, and finally we host walkthroughs/
      tutorials where members give a presentation showing audience members how to build something (ie an iPhone app or website).</p>
