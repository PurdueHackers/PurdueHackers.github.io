      <h4>What do you mean by "hacker"?</h4>
      <p>A hacker is simply someone who "hacks". "What's that mean?", you ask? We think
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> sums it up best when he said,
      "It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in
      common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit
      of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value". "</p>
      
      <h4>What kind of culture do you want to bring to Purdue?</h4>
      <p>Let's talk about the culture that we feel is already at Purdue first. Currently, we think the culture at Purdue is one that
      emphasizes things like high test scores/GPAs so students can graduate with lots of job offers, so they can make a lot of money working
      at a defense contractor, so they can sit in a cubible eight hours a day surrounded by fluorescent lighting, so they can design bombs.
      Ew. Gross.</p>
      
      <p>Instead, we want to bring hacker culture to Purdue.<p>
      
      <h4>How do you plan to do that?</h4>
      <p>We host a ton of events each year such as hack nights where anyone can come sit down and code, meet and network with
      fellow hackers, and most importantly learn from one another. We also host tech talks where members and industry professionals
      talk about how they're using the latest and greatest technology to build amazing things, and finally we host walkthroughs/
      tutorials where members give a presentation showing audience members how to build something (ie an iPhone app or website).</p>
