        <h2 class="featurette-heading">HACKERS<br/><span class="text-muted">ARE NOT CRACKERS</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">To us, the word hacker does not mean breaking into computer security systems. Instead we use the term "cracker" to describe those activities. We are a group of hackers who like to have fun, not some crazy black hat mafia. Here's how some of the best hackers in the tech world 
        have to say about what it means to be a hacker:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks into computers. Among programmers it means a good programmer."</p>
          <small><cite title="Paul Graham">Paul Graham</cite></small>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is 
          playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. 
          Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value"</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">CHANGING THE CULTURE<br/><span class="text-muted">AT PURDUE</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">We think Purdue needs to embrace the kind of "hacker culture" that's so commonly found in places like Silicon Valley, 
        Seattle, and Austin. Our mission is to bring that culture to Purdue by hosting events where hackers can meet and learn from one another as 
        well as build amazing things together.</p>
        <p class="lead">Right now most of our hackers are focused on hacking together awesome mobile/web apps and niffty hardware hacks, but we're 
        always growing our collective skillset. So if you're even a little bit interested in any of those things, stop by one of our events and 
        introduce yourself!</p>
