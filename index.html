      <h4>What do you mean by "hacker"?</h4>
      <p>A hacker is simply someone who "hacks". "What's that mean?", you ask? We think
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> sums it up best when he said,
      "It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in
      common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit
      of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value". "</p>
      
      <h4>What kind of culture do you want to bring to Purdue?</h4>
      <p>Let's talk about the culture that we feel is already at Purdue first. Currently, we think the culture at Purdue is one that
      emphasizes things like high test scores/GPAs so students can graduate with lots of job offers, so they can make a lot of money working
      at a defense contractor, so they can sit in a cubible eight hours a day surrounded by fluorescent lighting, so they can design bombs.

      <p>Instead, we want to bring hacker culture to Purdue.<p>
      
      <h4>How do you plan to do that?</h4>
